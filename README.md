# [in development] ESP-Pool-Thermometer

This is a project for an ESP8266-based pool thermometer that runs on Tasmota or ESPHome, transmits data over WiFi, and is as energy-efficient as possible as it is battery-powered (using the ESP's deep sleep function). The board is designed for assembly at JLCPCB.

Features
- DS18B20 temperature sensor
- Deep sleep for extended battery life
- WiFi data transmission
- Tasmota and ESPHome compatible
  
Hardware
- ESP8255 microcontroller
- DS18B20 temperature sensor
- 4-24V DC power supply
